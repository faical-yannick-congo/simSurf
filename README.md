Simulation and deformation of georeferenced geological surfaces. It is an updated version of the simulation and deformation modules in the qgSurf plugin (vers. 0.3.3) for Quantum GIS.
Two modules, "geosurface_simulation.py" and "geosurface_deformation.py" make possible to simulate and deform georeferenced surfaces: see html help in help folder.
